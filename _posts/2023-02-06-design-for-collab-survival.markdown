By engaging in collaborative survival design, which explores how design can reveal and support post-anthropocentric relationships, the researchers explore how three wearable technologies can engage, attune, and extend humans into the world of fungi. While the designs emulate traditional techniques, they encourage users to interact in different ways with the natural world (e.g., measure soil using fingers). In doing so, the designers aim to make users aware of their role as reliant partners, not protectors, of ecosystems. 
This pertains to SHCI as it is not so much concerned with individual consumption but highlighting how dependent we are on nature. Therefore, technology is not an adequate solution, but a starting point where we can begin to acknowledge the scale of our relationship with the natural world. 

Through the design of wearables that encourage multi-sensory interactivity, the authors pose how wearable technologies might encourage users to notice and engage with their environments. Highlighting how wearables could encourage playful behaviour, engaging the user, rather than displaying objective information, further removing the user. For our project, we might be inspired by how the wearables, being more like costumes than clothing, encouraged interaction. For instance, by prompting shoppers to be reviewers of supermarket sustainability, we might create a more conscious shopper.
