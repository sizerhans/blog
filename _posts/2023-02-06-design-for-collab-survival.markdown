By engaging in collaborative survival design, a practice which explores how design can reveal and support post-anthropocentric relationships, the Researchers explore how three wearable technologies can engage, attune, and extend humans into the word of fungi. By designing tools which extend human ability in noticing the natural world, encouraging users to engage in different behaviours (e.g., measure soil using fingers), this paper aims to make users aware of their role as reliant partners, not protector, of ecosystems. This pertains to SHCI as it is not so much concerned with individual consumption but highlighting how dependent we are on nature. A dependency which our anthropocentric tendencies have ignored. 

Therefore, technology is not an adequate solution, but a starting point where we can begin to acknowledge the scale of our relationship with the natural world. Through the design of wearables that encourage multi-sensory interactivity, the Authors pose how wearable technologies might encourage users to notice and engage with their environments. Suggesting that collaborative survival design technologies should be less concerned with displaying objective information, further removing the user, but novel ways to encourage playful behaviour, engaging the user. For our project, we might be inspired by how the Researchers used engagement and immersion to reveal the conditions of Microwork.
