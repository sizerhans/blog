This paper disputes the idea that climate awareness leads to action. Instead, they argue that developing a persons’ agency, through entertainment education as a vehicle for social learning, will result in a more action-based response to climate change. This education, they argue, should exemplify actionable ways for individuals and communities to respond to the climate emergency.
Therefore, rather than understanding users to be the problem, the design of computing systems might aim to provide users with the knowledge and ability to act on their climate concerns. Applied to SHCI, research might seek to understand current user constraints while employing new techniques e.g., pedagogy. 

In a similar fashion, our project aims to help users’ sustainably shop for food by providing them with information regarding how sustainable each item is. However, in recognising that users might be constrained in their ability to shop more sustainably, we might address the shopper’s lack of agency through the creation of a digital tool. This tool allows the user to communicate their dislike of unsustainable practices in the food industry with the various stakeholders (along the supply chain) through non-monetary means. This enables more equitable climate action outside of consumer choice, restoring the shopper’s agency.
