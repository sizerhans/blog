The researchers designed a ‘data sculpture’ that visualised the impact an individual’s diet has on the environment. Placing the sculptures in a communal office space aimed to provide individuals with a frame of reference to compare their behaviour. They found that the sculptures enabled individuals to understand the relationship between food consumption and environmental impact and prompted discussions around this inside and outside the office.  

Typical to the (SHCI) genre of ambient awareness, this paper perceives users as the problem. The hanging of the sculptures rewards or shames an individual’s behaviour (the less sustainable their diet, the lower it is to the floor). Without addressing the constraints that limit people’s ability to eat more sustainably, this paper lays the blame on individual consumption, consolidated through a culture of shaming. This might explain why the researchers found that the ‘data sculptures’ were ineffective at significantly changing individual diets.
The design of computing systems might be influenced by the researchers’ emphasis of social pressure as a tool to encourage interaction leading to more sustainable behaviour. For instance, in our project, we might think of how our sustainability reporting feature might require a distinctive gesture, which people might associate with socially good behaviour.
