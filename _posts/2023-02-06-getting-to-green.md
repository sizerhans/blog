Through a qualitative study of 15 households, this paper examines how and why householders modify their behaviours to limit resource consumption (gas, electricity and water). They found that participants were largely motivated by saving money, but the lack of meaningful feedback left households unaware of in-the-moment resource consumption.

Exemplary of formative user studies, this paper aims to understand why people are motivated/unable to carry out more sustainable behaviour. Rather than looking at individuals, the researchers highlight how different householders disagree on certain practices, resulting in an unclear picture of household consumption. While technology could be a solution, the researchers highlight that to motivate households to act out of interest of sustainability, they want to see the effects of their ‘green’ behaviour. The infrastructural changes required for this reflect the need for dramatic changes to encourage more conscious behaviour. This paper pertains to our project, and the development of computing systems, as it encourages us to consider the impact of our design interventions. Additionally, by understanding that users, without sustainable infrastructures, are often financially motivated to carry out sustainable behaviour, we might aim to design around existing cost-cutting practices to bridge the gap between the sustainable and cost shopper (Clear et al, 2016).
