This paper reviews SHCI papers (between 2019-2021) to understand how the field has developed and the consequences of this progression. While the authors don’t discount engaging with sustainability as a systemic issue, they highlight how the complexity of contemporary SHCI has struggled to provide measurable, impactful, results. Although, this conclusion could be influenced by the authors only considering papers from CHI. 
By acknowledging that technology is not the solution, the authors propose that instead of doing the work of the policy maker, SHCI should imagine, in a world where appropriate climate policy is passed, how to tackle more ‘traditional’ HCI problems. For instance, in understanding software to be a material of design, driving the obsolescence of computer hardware (Blevis, 2007), SHCI might look to understand how the design of computer systems might be changed to reflect a more sustainable computing industry. However, by focusing on ‘traditional’ problems, SHCI risks limiting the type of work that is done. 

In our group work, situated in the not far future, we might imagine our design in a world that is transitioning from mass climate regulation. Allowing us to imagine how our designs could flourish with the removal of current real-world restraints.
