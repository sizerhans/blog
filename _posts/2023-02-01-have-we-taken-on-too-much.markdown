This paper reviews SHCI CHI papers (between 2019-2021) to understand how the field has developed and the consequences of this progression. While the Authors don’t discount the usefulness of SHCI principles, such as systemic thinking over reducing individual resource consumption, they highlight how the complexity of contemporary SHCI has struggled to provide measurable, impactful, results.
 
By acknowledging that technology is not the solution, the Authors propose that instead of doing the work of the policy maker, SHCI should imagine, in a world where appropriate climate policy is passed, how to tackle more ‘traditional’ HCI problems (e.g., interface design supporting sustainable urban planning). Enabling SHCI to get to work with the design of sustainable technologies during a period that will undoubtedly require dramatic structural and personal consumption changes. For instance, in understanding software to be a material of design, driving the obsolescence of computer hardware (Blevis, 2007), SHCI might look to understand how the design of both hardware and software might be changed to reflect a more sustainable computing industry. In our group work, situated in the not far future, we might imagine our design in a world that is transitioning from mass climate regulation, or, on the other hand, a more dystopian one. Allowing us to imagine how our designs could flourish with the removal of current real-world restraints.
